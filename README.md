# 🐍 Python Programming Internship – Task 1  
### Core Python Challenges

🚀 This repository contains **Week 1 tasks** completed as part of my **Python Programming Internship** at **Maincrafts Technology**.  
The objective of this task was to strengthen my **core Python fundamentals**, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

---

## 📖 Task Overview

This task focuses on solving **basic yet essential Python problems** that form the foundation for advanced concepts such as automation, APIs, and data-driven applications.

Each program is written in a **clean, beginner-friendly, and efficient manner**, following proper coding practices.

---

## 🛠️ Problems Solved

Below is the list of challenges implemented in this task:

1. **Sum of Two Numbers**  
   ➤ Takes two user inputs and prints their sum.

2. **Odd or Even Checker**  
   ➤ Checks whether a given number is odd or even.

3. **Factorial Calculation**  
   ➤ Calculates factorial of a number using a loop.

4. **Fibonacci Sequence**  
   ➤ Generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

5. **String Reverse**  
   ➤ Reverses a string entered by the user.

6. **Palindrome Check**  
   ➤ Checks whether a word reads the same forward and backward.

7. **Leap Year Check**  
   ➤ Determines whether a given year is a leap year.

8. **Armstrong Number Check**  
   ➤ Verifies if a number is an Armstrong number  
   *(Example: 153 → 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153)*
